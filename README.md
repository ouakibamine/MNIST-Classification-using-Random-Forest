## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a classification model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model should generalize well to unseen data and achieve high accuracy in classifying digits.

## Dataset Description
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.

## Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images (e.g., normalization, flattening) and prepare the data for model training.
- Model Training: Train a Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and features associated with different digits.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Randomized Search and Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
- Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Results and Analysis: Analyze the results, visualize the performance metrics, and identify areas for improvement.
